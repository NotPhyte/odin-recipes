# odin-recipes
This current project will test how well I can use the html skills I learned from the odin project. From completing this project, I learned how to create hyperlinks to other relative links within the page. I also learned how to use absolute links in images to help display the pictures i wanted. This project also required the use of headings and lists. I hope to learn more as I do more projects.

Doing this project helped me solidify my understanding based on the lessons so far in the course.
