    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The secret to making scrambled eggs is all about patience...
      and the proper pan. Here's a quick step-by-step guide to show 
      you how to make scrambled eggs, plus we'll answer your most 
      frequently asked questions.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 to 6 eggs</li>
      <li>4 to 6 tablespoons of milk</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Break eggs on a flat surface and put in bowl</li>
      <li>Add milk to make creamier, up to 1 tablespoon per egg</li>
      <li>Heat pan with butter or oil</li>
      <li>When the butter starts to bubble, or a drop of water added to 
        the pan sizzles, slowly pour in the egg mixture. Immediately reduce
         the heat to medium-low and as soon as the eggs begin to "set" or 
         form a slightly solid base (a minute or two), gently stir with a
          rubber spatula.
      </li>
      <li>Add minced herbs and other optional ingredients when egg begins to curd</li>
      <li>Remove the pan from heat and continue to stir until the eggs finish cooking, serve immediately on plates</li>

    </ol>
